# Python - Inheritance

This directory contains tasks related to **inheritance in Python**.

The goal of this project is to understand and practice:
- Class inheritance
- Parent and child classes
- Method overriding
- Built-in functions like `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `dir`
- Attribute and method resolution order (MRO)

Each file in this directory focuses on a specific concept of inheritance and object-oriented programming in Python, following Holberton School standards.

All scripts are written in Python 3 and are PEP8 compliant.
